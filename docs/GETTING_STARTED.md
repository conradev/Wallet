# Getting Started

In order to build the project, make sure you first clone all of the submodules:

```bash
$ git submodules update --init --recursive
```

## macOS and iOS

In order to build for Apple platforms, you will need to be developing on a Mac and you will need to download [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Open the Xcode project (`Apple/Wallet.xcodeproj`) and build and run the app using the `App (iOS)` or `App (macOS)` schemes.

## Android

In order to build for Android, you will need to download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Open the repository in Android Studio and build and run the app using the `Android` configuration.
