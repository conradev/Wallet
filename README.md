Wallet is an as-of-yet unnamed cryptocurrency wallet. It will initially be released with Ethereum support on macOS, iOS and Android. It is still _**very early**_ and not yet in a state where anyone can use it for anything.

You can read about the [goals](docs/GOALS.md) of the project or check out the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md).
